# Notes on conversion

* Always specify zoom levels as either >= or < . Don't use either = or =<
* Open curly braces on the same line, and close on an empty line.
* One space before and after =  etc
* Two space indents. No tabs.
* space after : but no before
* If there is a `&minscale_zoom18;`, ignore it. These really mess up any attempts to run the style at z19
